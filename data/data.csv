5 GHz VS 2 GHz,"5 GHz higher bandwidth, more channels and less crowded than 2.4 GHz, but range lower. 2.4 GHz range higher but slower bandwidth, fewer channels and more crowded."
802.11 Standards,"802.11 - 2.4 GHz, up to 2 Mbps. 802.11a - 5 GHz, up to 54 Mbps, small coverage, not interoperable w. 802.11b and 802.11g. 802.11b - 2.4 GHz, up to 11 Mbps, longer range than 802.11a. 802.11g - 2.4 GHz, up to 54 Mbps, backwards compatible w. 802.11b w. reduced bandwidth capacity. 802.11n - 2.4 & 5 GHz, range from 150 Mbps to 600 Mbps, up to 70m range, APs & clients need multiple antennas using MIMO technology, backwards compatible w. 802.11a/b/g devices w. limiting data rates. 802.11ac - 5 GHz, range from 450 Mbps to 1.3 Gbps using MIMO technology, backwards compatible with 802.11a/n devices. 802.11ax - 2.4 & 5 GHz, a.k.a. Wi-Fi 6 or High-Efficiency Wireless (HEW), better power efficncy., higher data rates, handle many devices. Will use 1 & 7 GHz when available."
802.1X,"Client - Supplicant, Switch - Authenticator, Authentication Server"
AAA,"Authentication, Authorization, Accounting.  Authentication - Usernames and passwords to verify the user's identity. Authorization - Controls what users can and cannot do on the network. Accounting - Collects and reports usage data, for auditing or billing. Uses TACAS+ and RADIUS to authenticate users on a central db."
Access Internet,Any address with the 10 in the first octet (e.g. 10.0.10.0) is private IPv4 and need to use Network Address Translation (NAT) to convert private IPv4 address to internet-routable IPv4 addresses.
Access port ,A switch port that sends and expects traffic with no VLAN tag. Only for 1 vlan.port send/expects to receive tagged traffic. 
Advantage of Cisco Router as relay agent ,"Provides relay services for multiple UDP services, e.g. Port 37 Times, Port 53 DNS, etc."
Alleviate Network Congestion,"Fast port speeds - more data transfer per second, but more expensive; Fast internal switching - fast internal bus or shared memory; Large frame buffers - Store more frames instead of drop them, good for duplex mismatch. High port density - more ports, local traffic, less switches needed, less collisions."
AP Broadcast Frame,"AP may regularly broadcast beacons. Probing, authentication and association frames are used only during association/reassociation process."
AP Discovery,A wireless NIC will send probe requests and receive broadcast beacon frames to discover an AP.
AP Modes,"Passive - AP periodically sends broadcast beacon frames containing SSID, supported standards, security settings. Active - Hidden and clients need to know the name of the SSID. Client sends a probe request."
Auto-MDIX ,Auto configures the port to allow device connections to use either straight-through or crossover cable. Turn on MDIX (interface config): auto mdix. Check MDIX: show controllers ethernet-controller <interface> phy
Before creating WLAN,Create a new VLAN interface. Each WLAN on Cisco 3500 WLC needs its own VLAN interface.
Best Practice - CDP & LLDP,Disable both protocols on interfaces where they are not required.
Best Practice - Home WAP,"Wireless network password, AP password, SSID"
Blocked ports ,"Not root nor designated port so, blocked."
Boot Sequence ,"Power-on self-test (POST) > Boot Loader > CPU init. > Flash memory init. > BOOT envr. varbl. locates IOS, IOS takes over."
BPDU,Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) share info about themselves and their connections and are used to elect the root port.
Bridge ID (BID) Components ,"REDIRECT,Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU)"
Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU) ,"Bridge Priority (4 bits), Extended System ID (12 bits), MAC Address (48 bits). See Root Bridge Election"
Broadcast Domain ,"Where broadcast frames will reach. L2 switches, hubs and bridges extend the broadcast domain. Routers divide domains since they block broadcasts. Link between routers counts as broadcast domain."
Broadcast Storm ,Abnormally high number of broadcasts overwhelming the network during a specific amount of time.
CAPWAP,"IEEE standard procotol, provides encapsulation & forwarding of wireless user traffic btwn AP and WLC."
Channel,"Adjusting channels is to avoid interference from nearby wireless devices. 1, 6 and 11 are good because they are 5 channels apart, minimising interference with other channels. Channel range is 1-11."
Check IP address that is assigned to MAC address,show ip dhcp binding (See show ip dhcp binding for more info)
Collision Domain,"Only when half duplex is used. Collision happens on half duplex side. Hub increases collision domain, while switches, routers and bridges divide collision domains. To alleviate network congestion due to collisions, use a high port density switch (see Alleviate Network Congestion)"
Configure SSH,"1 - Verify SSH support by using show ip ssh. 2 - Config IP domain by using ip domain-name <domain name>. 3 - Generate RSA key pairs by using cypto key generate rsa. 4 - Config user authentication by using username <username> secret <password>. 5 - Config vty lines by going to vty config using line vty 0 15 then type transport input ssh, then login local."
Configuring a router as a DHCP client ,"Enter the interface to configure, then type ip address dhcp"
Create/Configure ,"For VLAN, go to VLAN Creation. For others, check the bottom. For steps before creating WLAN, see Before creating WLAN."
Cut-Through Switching,"Can do rapid frame switching and has lower latency than Store-and-Forward switching. Once the destination MAC address of the frame has been looked up, forwarding decisions can be made. However due to no FCS check, invalid frames may be forwarded."
Designated Port When There is No Root Port ,Leaves segments between two switches where both switches is not the root bridge. Theport on the switch with the least-cost path to the root bridge is the designated port.
Designated Port ,"When There is a Root Port If one end of a segment is a root port, then the other end is a designated port."
Designated Ports on Root Bridge ,All ports on the root bridge are designated ports. This is because the root bridge has the lowest cost to itself.
DHCP Client Boot Up ,A DHCP enabled client PC will send two broadcast messages - DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPREQUEST (see DHCPv4 Operation)
DHCP message types ,DHCPACK - the DHCP server confirming that the address lease has been accepted. DHCPREQUEST - The client accepting the IP address provided by the DHCP server. DHCPDISCOVER - Client initiating message to find a DHCP server. DHCPOFFER - DHCP responding to the initial request by a client.
DHCP Port Number ,67 and 68 (if there's only 1 option select 67)
DHCPv4 Operation ,Client sends Discover broadcast to find a DHCP server (DHCPDISCOVER) > Server responds init. request and sends Offer (DHCPOFFER) > Client accepts and sends Request (DHCPREQUEST) > Server confirms lease and sends DHCP Acknowledgement (DHCPACK)
DHCPv4 Relay ,"In the interface to the network, type ip helper-address <ip address of DHCP server>. Verify using show ip interface."
DHCPv6 Relay ,"In the interface to the network, type ipv6 dhcp relay destination ipv6-address [interface]. To verify, type show ipv6 dhcp interface."
DHCPv6 Server Types ,Stateless - Enabled in RA messages with the ipv6 nd other-config-flag command. Clients send only DHCPv6 INFORMATION REQUEST msgs. Enabled on client using ipv6 address autoconfig command.
DHCPv6 Server Types ,"Stateful - M flag is 1 in RA msgs, uses address command to create pool of addresses, enabled on client using ipv6 address dhcp"
DHCP Starvation Attack,"Legitimate users will not be able to get valid IP addresses, Layer 2 attack."
Disable DTP ,On links where trunking is not intended and when a Cisco switch is connected to a non-Cisco switch. See nonegotiate.
DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol) ,"Only on Cisco switches, used to auto negotiate trunking with another device. Links dynamically attempt trunking. Do not use for non-Cisco switches."
DTP modes ,Dynamic desirable: Actively attempts to convert link to trunk; Dynamic auto: Waits for neighbour to initiate trunking; 
Duplex ,"If one side is full & other is half, late collision occurs on the half side. To config full duplex, use duplex full in interface config."
Election of Designated Ports (STP),All ports on the root bridge are designated ports. This is because the root bridge has the lowest cost to itself.
Election of Root Bridge (STP),"Switch with the lowest bridge ID (see Bridge ID Components) becomes root bridge. If two BIDs are the same, switch with lowest MAC address will win."
Election of Root Ports (STP),Root port is selected based on the lowest overall cost (best path) to the root bridge. See Root Path Cost for calculating cost.

VRRPv2 - IPv4, one router is elected as master, rest are backups. VRRPv3 - Added support for IPv6. GLBP - Cisco Prop., allows load balancing. GLBP for IPv6 - Same thing but for IPv6. IRDP - Legacy, hosts locate routers that provide connectivity to other networks."
FlexConnect,"FlexConnect is a wireless solution for branch and remote office deployments, and allows you to control access points in a branch office from the corporate office through a WAN link, without deploying a controller in each office.<br><br><b>Connected mode</b> - WLC is reachable, FlexConnect AP has CAPWAP connectivity with its WLC and can send traffic through CAPWAP tunnel.<br><b>Standalone mode</b> - WLC in unreachable. FlexConnect AP can assume some of the WLC functions like switching client data locally and client authentication locally."
Frame Check Sequence (FCS),The switch checks the last field of the datagram against its own FCS calculations. FCS checks for errors to ensure the frame is free of physical and data link errors.
Hello Message,"Part of HSRP. Hello messages are sent every 3 seconds by default. If no hello message is received for 10 seconds, the standby router will become the active one."
Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) ,Transparent failover of first hope device; router. Used within a grp of routers for selecting active device and standby device for gateway services to a LAN.
HSRP,"Cisco Proprietary Protocol. Uses active and standby routers. By default, device with the highest IPv4 addr is elected as the active router, except if a HSRP priority value is set. Priority is 100 by default, highest priority becomes active router. Active router sends Hello Messages every 3 seconds by default. Standby router becomes active one after 10 seconds if no hello message is received. No load balancing."
HSRP States,"Initial - First state after config change or when interface first becomes available. Learn - Router has not determined the virtual IP addr and has not seen hello messages from the active router. It will be waiting for messages from the active router. Listen - The router knows the virtual IP addr, but the router is neither the active router nor the standby router. It listens for hello messages from those routers. Speak - The router sends periodic hello messages and actively participates in the election of the active and/or standby router. Standby - The router is a candidate to become the next active router and sends periodic hello messages. Active - The router won the election."

Link Aggregation Protocols,"REDIRECT,EtherChannel Types"
Local AAA,Ideal for small networks where the username and password is stored in the router.
Lower sender port priority ,"Default port priority is 128. If 1 switch’s port were configured with a lower port priority, other switch’s port in forwarding state. The other port on S4 would be a blocking state, prevent loop."
Lowest overall cost to root bridge ,"REDIRECT,Root Port Election"
MAC addr table full,Switch will treat all frames as unknown unicast and flood all incoming frames to all ports in the local VLAN.
Management Frames,"For management frames by AP, see AP Broadcast Frames."
Management Interface Creation (only on the management device) ,"In global config, type interface vlan <vlan id>, then ip add <ip addr> <subnet>, no shutdown, then go back to global config,and type ip default-gateway <ip addr>"

Routed Ports ,"Ports on a Layer 3 switch that are used for routing. For configuration, see no switchport."
Router-on-a-Stick Configuration ,"Create the vlans (see VLAN creation), create mgmnt interface (see Management Interface Creation), configure access ports, configure trunking ports (see Trunking commands), then configure the subinterface & IP address (see Subinterface Configuration)."
Router-on-a-Stick Disadvantages ,Requires an extra router; Does not scale well beyond 50 VLANs due to network congestion.
Router-on-a-Stick ,"Where a router is being used to route traffic between vlans, and one connection between a router & switch serves all of the vlans. The interface on the router will have subinterfaces which connect to each vlan. To connect to a switch, you need to use trunking."

Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) ,Prevent L2 loops which can result in broadcast storms by disabling redundant paths. Can calculate best path when there is a failure. No STP = Endless loop of frames + high CPU utilization n MAC address table instability. 
SSH (Secure Shell) ,Pretty much the same as Telnet but SSH has encryption so more secure.
SSH/Telnet Configuration ,"In the vty lines, enter transport input all / transport input ssh / transport input telnet."
Store-and-Forward Switching,"Two characteristics: Error checking and Automatic buffering. Error checking does a frame check sequence (FCS) after receiving the whole frame. If the frame has no errors, it Is forwarded. Otherwise, it is dropped. Automatic Buffering allows flexibility for different Ethernet speeds."
STP Types ,"<b>STP</b> - Original IEEE version, assumes 1 spanning tree regardless of VLANs. <b>PVST+</b> - Cisco enhancement of STP, provides separate tree instance for each VLAN, supports PortFast, UplinkFast, BackboneFast, BPU guard & filter, root and loop guards. RSTP - Faster upgrade of STP. <b>Rapid PVST+</b> - Cisco enhancement  of RSTP, each separate tree insurance supports the services above in PVST+. <b>MSTP</b> - IEEE standard, maps multiple VLANs to same spanning tree instance. <b>MST</b> - Same physical and logical topology as MSTP, provides 16 instances of RSTP and combines many VLANs into the same physical and logical topology as RSTP instance. Supports services like PVST+ above."

Telnet Port,TCP port 23
Telnet ,"Sends everything in plain text, including usernames & passwords. Use SSH instead as it's more secure."
Transport Input ,"Specifies which connection (SSH/Telnet/both) to allow on vty lines. To configure, go to vty lines (line vty 0-15) then type transport input <all | ssh | telnet>"
Trunking commands ,"In Interface config, turn on trunk mode: switchport mode trunk, set native vlan (if needed): switchport trunk native vlan <vlan id>, allow vlans on the trunk: switchport trunk allowed vlan <vlan list>"
Trunking ,"Trunk ports do not show in show vlan brief as they do not belong to a vlan. Trunk port sends/expects to receive tagged traffic.  | CFI | VID (2 bytes, 3 bits, 1 bit, 12 bits) Tag: |ethernet type(0X8100) | Pri | CFI | VID| (2 bytes, 3 bits, 1 bit, 12 bits)."

VLAN creation ,"In global config, enter vlan <vlan id>, then name <vlan-name>"
VLAN deletion ,"To delete only 1 vlan, in global config, enter no vlan <vlan id>. To delete all vlans, in exec mode, run delete flash:vlan.dat. Ports won't be disabled, but they will just stop communicating with the attached devices."
VLAN double-tagging attack,A VLAN Hopping Attack where the attacker embeds a hidden 802.1Q tag inside the frame that already has an 802.1Q tag. This allows the frame to go to a VLAn that the original 802.1Q tag did not specify.
,The native and user VLANs being the same makes it vulnerable to VLAN double-tagging attacks.
VLAN tag field ,Type - Value for the tag protocol ID value. VLAN ID - VLAN number. User Priority - Value that supports level or service implementation. Canonical Format Identifier - Identifier that enables Token Ring frames to be carried across Ethernet links.
