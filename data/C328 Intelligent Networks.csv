Designated Port When There is No Root Port ,Leaves segments between two switches where both switches is not the root bridge. Theport on the switch with the least-cost path to the root bridge is the designated port.
Designated Ports on Root Bridge ,All ports on the root bridge are designated ports. This is because the root bridge has the lowest cost to itself.
DHCP Client Boot Up ,A DHCP enabled client PC will send two broadcast messages - DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPREQUEST (see DHCPv4 Operation)

Duplex ,"If one side is full & other is half, late collision occurs on the half side. To config full duplex, use duplex full in interface config."
Election of Designated Ports (STP),All ports on the root bridge are designated ports. This is because the root bridge has the lowest cost to itself.
Election of Root Bridge (STP),"Switch with the lowest bridge ID (see Bridge ID Components) becomes root bridge. If two BIDs are the same, switch with lowest MAC address will win."

How does virtualization help with disaster recovery within a data center?,Support of live migration
HSRP,"Cisco Proprietary Protocol. Uses active and standby routers. By default, device with the highest IPv4 addr is elected as the active router, except if a HSRP priority value is set. Priority is 100 by default, highest priority becomes active router. Active router sends Hello Messages every 3 seconds by default. Standby router becomes active one after 10 seconds if no hello message is received. No load balancing."
HSRP States,"Initial - First state after config change or when interface first becomes available. Learn - Router has not determined the virtual IP addr and has not seen hello messages from the active router. It will be waiting for messages from the active router. Listen - The router knows the virtual IP addr, but the router is neither the active router nor the standby router. It listens for hello messages from those routers. Speak - The router sends periodic hello messages and actively participates in the election of the active and/or standby router. Standby - The router is a candidate to become the next active router and sends periodic hello messages. Active - The router won the election."

Which cloud model provides services for a specific organization or entity?,A private cloud
Which component in a traditional infrastructure device provides Layer 2 and Layer 3 functions to create data paths within a network?,Control plane
Which feature provides secure access to MIB objects?,Community Strings
Which is a characteristic of a Type 1 hypervisor?,<b>Installed directly on a server?</b><br<<br><b>Explanation:</b> Type 1 hypervisors are installed directly on a server and are known as 'bare metal' solutions giving direct access to hardware resources. They also require a management console and are best suited for enterprise environments.?
Which Layer 2 attack will result in legitimate users not getting valid IP addresses?,DHCP Starvation
Which network traffic management technology is a basic element in SDN implementations?,OpenFlow
Which one of the following statements describes the behaviour of a switch when the MAC address/CAM table is full?,It treats all frames as unknown unicast and floods all incoming frames to all ports within the local VLAN.
Which statement describes the concept of cloud computing?,Separation of application from hardware
Which three Cisco products focus on endpoint security solutions? (Choose three.),"Web Security Appliance, Email Security Appliance, NAC Appliance."
Which two concepts is for switch ports to connect only end devices and not to another switch? ,"Edge Port, PortFast"
Which two layers of the OSI model are associated with SDN network control plane functions that make forwarding decisions?,"<b>Layer 2, Layer 3</b><br><br><b>Explanation:</b> The SDN control plane uses the Layer 2 ARP table and the Layer 3 routing table to make decisions about forwarding traffic."
Which type of Hypervisor is implemented when a user with a laptop running the Mac OS installs a Windows virtual OS instance?,"<b>Type 2</b><br><br><b>Explanation:</b> Type 2 hypervisors, also know as hosted hypervisors, are installed on top of an existing operating system, such as Mac OS, Windows, or Linux."
Which type of hypervisor would most likely be used in a data center?,<b>Type 1</b><br><br><b>Explanation:</b> The two type of hypervisors are Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 hypervisors are usually used on enterprise servers. Enterprise servers rather than virtualized PCs are more likely to be in a data center.
Why Active Clients for IPv6 is 0 ,"The state is not maintained by the DHCPv6 server under stateless mode. When the command ipv6 nd other-config-flag is set, the DHCPv6 does not maintain state information. (Stateless)"
Why DHCPDISCOVER is broadcast ,Client doesn't have IP address yet to send unicast messages.
Why DHCPREQUEST is broadcast ,"Client may have received offers from multiple servers, broadcast is to decline those offers."
Why ISP assigns DHCP to Wireless Router in SOHO environment ,Easy IP address management
Windows failed to get IPv4 address ,Windows will automatically set the IP address to start with 168.254.
Wireless antennas,"Omnidirectional - 360 deg coverage, ideal for home, open office area, conference room, outdoors. Directional - Focus radio signal in one direction, stronger signal strength in one direction and reduced in other directions. Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) - Multiple antennas to increase bandwidth for 802.11n/ac/ax networks, up to eight transmit and receive antennas can be used."
Wireless network not showing,Access point may be operating in active mode.
Wireless security modes,"Personal - One shared password for all users. Enterprise -Users need to login with username and password, RADIUS server authenticates them."
Broadcast Address (MAC address),FFFF.FFFF.FFFF
2019-ESE-Q1,"Figure 1 shows 4 PCs (PC1, PC2, PC3 and PC4) with their MAC addresses shown are connected to a switch.
