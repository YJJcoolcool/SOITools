HSRP,"Cisco Proprietary Protocol. Uses active and standby routers. By default, device with the highest IPv4 addr is elected as the active router, except if a HSRP priority value is set. Priority is 100 by default, highest priority becomes active router. Active router sends Hello Messages every 3 seconds by default. Standby router becomes active one after 10 seconds if no hello message is received. No load balancing."
HSRP States,"Initial - First state after config change or when interface first becomes available. Learn - Router has not determined the virtual IP addr and has not seen hello messages from the active router. It will be waiting for messages from the active router. Listen - The router knows the virtual IP addr, but the router is neither the active router nor the standby router. It listens for hello messages from those routers. Speak - The router sends periodic hello messages and actively participates in the election of the active and/or standby router. Standby - The router is a candidate to become the next active router and sends periodic hello messages. Active - The router won the election."

SNMP Trap Messages,Unsolicited messages alerting the SNMP manager to a condition or event on the network such as a link being down. Trap-directed notifications reduce network and agent resources by eliminating the need for some of SNMP polling requests.
Spanning Tree Algorithm (STA) ,Select root bridge > Block redundant path > Loop free topography > Link failure = recalculate path.
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) ,Prevent L2 loops which can result in broadcast storms by disabling redundant paths. Can calculate best path when there is a failure. No STP = Endless loop of frames + high CPU utilization n MAC address table instability. 
SSH (Secure Shell) ,Pretty much the same as Telnet but SSH has encryption so more secure.
SSH/Telnet Configuration ,"In the vty lines, enter transport input all / transport input ssh / transport input telnet."
Store-and-Forward Switching,"Two characteristics: Error checking and Automatic buffering. Error checking does a frame check sequence (FCS) after receiving the whole frame. If the frame has no errors, it Is forwarded. Otherwise, it is dropped. Automatic Buffering allows flexibility for different Ethernet speeds."
STP Types ,"<b>STP</b> - Original IEEE version, assumes 1 spanning tree regardless of VLANs. <b>PVST+</b> - Cisco enhancement of STP, provides separate tree instance for each VLAN, supports PortFast, UplinkFast, BackboneFast, BPU guard & filter, root and loop guards. RSTP - Faster upgrade of STP. <b>Rapid PVST+</b> - Cisco enhancement  of RSTP, each separate tree insurance supports the services above in PVST+. <b>MSTP</b> - IEEE standard, maps multiple VLANs to same spanning tree instance. <b>MST</b> - Same physical and logical topology as MSTP, provides 16 instances of RSTP and combines many VLANs into the same physical and logical topology as RSTP instance. Supports services like PVST+ above."
Subinterface Configuration ,"In the subinterface config (e.g. interface G0/0/1.10 for vlan 10), type encapsulation dot1Q <vlan id>, then type ip add <ip addr> <subnet mask>. (Good to put description too)"
SVI inter-vlan routing benefits ,"Faster switching of packets, and there is no need for a connection to a router."
Switch Boot Up Sequence,<ol><li>Switch loads and executes Power-On-Self-Test (POST)</li><li>Switch loads boot loader software.</li><li>Boot loader performs low-level CPU initialization.</li><li>Boot loader initializes flash memory.</li><li>Boot loader locates and loads default IOS image from BOOT environment variable.</li></ol>
Switch Buffers,"Switches have large frame buffers that allow data waiting to be transmitted to be stored so the data will not be dropped. This feature is beneficial especially if the incoming traffic is from a faster port than the egress port used for transmitting, and prevents premature frame discarding when network congestion occurs.<br>Related questions:<i><ul><li>How do switch buffers affect network performance?</li></ul></i>"
Switch Forwarding Methods ,"Store & forward: Check for errors, if err drop frame, auto buffering for duplex mismatch. Cut-through: Ignore errors, less latency."

Switch Mode ,"Between Switch and Router/Switch, use trunk."
Switch Operation,"Switches use their CAM table which maps MAC addresses to ports (interface) to make frame forwarding decisions.<br><br>When a frame is received, the switch checks if the Source MAC address is in the CAM table, if not, it adds it and its port to the table. Otherwise, it sends the frame to the port associated with that MAC address in addr table.<br>If the destination MAC address is not in the CAM table, the switch broadcasts the frame to all ports except the ingress port. Otherwise, it sends it to the port associated with that MAC address in the CAM table."
Switch Ports ,"For when assigned VLAN is deleted, go to VLAN deletion."
Switch Verification commands,"<b>show interfaces <interface></b>: disp. interface stat and config.<br><b>show startup-config</b>: disp. current startup config.<br><b>show interfaces <i>interface</i> switchport</b>: Display encapsulation type, voice VLAN ID, access mode VLAN, Verify Trunk Encapsulation, etc.<br><b>show running-config</b>: Display current running config.<br><b>show flash</b>: Display info about flash file sys.<br><b>show version</b>: Display sys. hardware and software stat.<br><b>show history</b>: disp. history of command entered.<br><b>show ip[v6] interface <interface id></b>: disp.

Two-Tier topographly,"In a typical two-tier spine-leaf topology, every lower-tier switch, or the leaf layer, is connected to each of the top-tier switches, or the spine layer in a full-mesh topology.<br><br>However, the lower-tier switches are not connected to each other due to scalability issues in large networks. "
Types of Wireless Networks,"WPAN - Wireless Personal-Area Network, low powered transmitters, short range network, based on 802.15 standard and 2.4 GHz. WLAN - Wireless LAN, uses transmitters to cover medium sized network. Suitable for home, office and campus. Based on 802.11 standard, uses 2.4 or 5 GHz.  WMAN - Wireless Metropolitan Area Network, uses transmitters to cover a larger geographic area, suitable for cities / districts, use specific licensed frequencies. WWAN - Wireless Wide Area Networks, uses transmitters to cover an extensive geographic area, suitable for national and global comms, also use specific licensed frequencies."
Untagged frames ,Use native vlan (see VLAN types - native)

VLAN benefits ,"Smaller bcast domains, more security as devices can only comm. in same vlan, improved network efficiency & perf., cost reduction as no need to buy switches, simple project & app mgment. Separate functions makes specialised apps easier."
VLAN communication ,Devices can only communicate within the same vlan. e.g. broadcast cannot go from vlan 20 to vlan 30.
VLAN creation ,"In global config, enter vlan <vlan id>, then name <vlan-name>"
VLAN deletion ,"To delete only 1 vlan, in global config, enter no vlan <vlan id>. To delete all vlans, in exec mode, run delete flash:vlan.dat. Ports won't be disabled, but they will just stop communicating with the attached devices."
VLAN double-tagging attack,A VLAN Hopping Attack where the attacker embeds a hidden 802.1Q tag inside the frame that already has an 802.1Q tag. This allows the frame to go to a VLAn that the original 802.1Q tag did not specify.<br><br>The native and user VLANs being the same makes it vulnerable to VLAN double-tagging attacks.
VLAN tag field ,Type - Value for the tag protocol ID value. VLAN ID - VLAN number. User Priority - Value that supports level or service implementation. Canonical Format Identifier - Identifier that enables Token Ring frames to be carried across Ethernet links.
VLAN types ,"<ul><li><b>Default</b> (vlan 1, default mgment vlan)</li><li><b>data</b> (separate network into groups of users or devices), <b>management</b> (for SSH, Telnet, HTTP(S), SNMP)</li><li><b>native</b> (default vlan 1, used for trunks, untagged across trunks, provide a common identifier across trunks)</li><li><b>voice</b> (for VoIP, delay < 150ms, priority)</li></ul>"
